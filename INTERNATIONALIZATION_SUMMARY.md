# 🌍 Internationalization Summary

## ✅ Completed Translation

All Chinese content in the project has been successfully translated to English:

### 1. Core Files Translated
- **sim_core.py**: All comments, docstrings, and output messages
- **app.py**: All UI text, error messages, and user prompts
- **experiments.py**: All function descriptions and print statements
- **run_experiments.py**: All demo script content
- **README.md**: Complete documentation translation

### 2. Key Translation Changes

#### Code Comments
```python
# Before: 检查库存
# After: Check inventory

# Before: 补货过程
# After: Replenishment process

# Before: 策略选择（支持老化因子）
# After: Strategy selection (supports aging factor)
```

#### User Interface
```python
# Before: "请选择至少一个策略再运行。"
# After: "Please select at least one policy to run."

# Before: "正在运行仿真..."
# After: "Running simulation..."

# Before: "仿真失败：{e}"
# After: "Simulation failed: {e}"
```

#### Documentation
- All section headers translated
- All parameter descriptions translated
- All feature descriptions translated
- All usage examples translated

### 3. Maintained Functionality

✅ **All functionality preserved**
- Simulation logic unchanged
- UI behavior identical
- Output format consistent
- Error handling maintained

✅ **Code quality maintained**
- Variable names unchanged (already in English)
- Function names unchanged
- Class structure preserved
- Import statements unchanged

### 4. Testing Results

The fully internationalized system works perfectly:
